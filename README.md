# **Welcome to Game Center**

Game Center is a console application written in Java.

**Games offered by Game Center are:**

1. Tic Tac Toe

    > Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

2. Rock Paper Scissors
    > Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.
3. Math Quiz
    > Math Quiz is a game where you have to answer 10 questions in 60 seconds. The questions are randomly generated and the difficulty increases as you answer more questions correctly.
